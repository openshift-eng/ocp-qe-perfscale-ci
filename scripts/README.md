### Mr. Sandman
Sometimes, the only way to get data such as UUID and workload timestamp information is directly from the workload job runs. If you find yourself in need of this but don't want to manually pour through logs, you can let Mr. Sandman give it a shot by running `./scripts/sandman.py --file <path/to/out/file>`
